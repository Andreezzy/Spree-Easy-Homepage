# Spree Easy Homepage

This is a complete open source [Spree](https://github.com/spree/spree) extension for easily managing your homepage products. The current default operation for managing your homepage is cumbersome and time consuming for what is suppose to be a simple operation. Spree also does not include related frontend helpers which would require effort from the programmer to create and maintain.

**Spree Easy Homepage** provides a beautiful and intuitive interface for populating and categorizing products without compromising ease of use. Developers would be delighted to know that setup is as simple as calling a single method from the view.


Getting Started
----------------------

##### Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:

```ruby
gem 'spree_easy_homepage'
```

##### Install the gem

```shell
bundle install
```

##### Run the install generators from your console

```shell
rails g spree_easy_homepage:install
```

Frontend Setup
----------------------

#### To populate your homepage with products

Expose this gem's frontend helper in your controller, eg:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  helper Spree::EasyHomepageHelper
end
```
Then from your view, add the helper method `fill_with_sections` eg:

```
<div class="row">
  <%= fill_with_sections %>
</div>
```

Admins can manage their Homepage by navigating to the configurations tab from the Admin sidebar.

#### Thats it!

`fill_with_sections` defaults to use the product "tile" partial in `app/views/spree/products/_product.html.erb`. If none are found in your project folder, the call is delegated to the official "tile" partial used by Spree.

The default product "tile" partial can be optionally overridden by passing `locals: {product_partial: '/path/to/tile_partial'}` in `fill_with_sections` arguments. EG:

```ruby
fill_with_sections(locals: {product_partial: 'spree/shared/product_tile'})
```

If you want to pass variables to the product "tile" partial, you can use `product_locals: {}`, similar to the procedure above. EG:

```ruby
fill_with_sections(locals: {product_locals: {taxon: @taxon, product_tile_size: :small}})
```

deep inside the helper, between the products loop, the locals passed from the above code is passed to the product "tile" partial:

```ruby
render partial: 'spree/products/product', locals: {product: product, taxon: @taxon, product_tile_size: :small}
```

Information
----------------------

#### Editing the view generated by `fill_with_sections`

By default, `fill_with_sections` renders the `_home_sections.html.erb` partial located in `app/views/spree/shared/`. To change the default path.

```ruby
fill_with_sections(partial: 'spree/shared/custom_home_sections')
```

or simply create a `_home_sections.html.erb` partial file in your `spree/shared` folder.

If you want to edit the HTML elements outputted by `fill_with_sections`. Investigate the `shared/_home_sections.html.erb` partial from the gem then override with your edited version in your main project as instructed above.

Testing via Rspec
----------------------

From the gem's root folder

```shell
bundle install
```

Generate a dummy app via Rspec

```shell
bundle exec rake generate_dummy_app
```

Then call Rspec

```shell
rspec
```

Note: for feature tests, chrome (headless) is selected by default.


##### Run the install generators from your console

```shell
rails g spree_easy_homepage:install
```
